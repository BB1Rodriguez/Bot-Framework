#Hello There read this for more Info.

The Idea behind the Bot-Framework Project is to have a tool for Pen Testing or
just simply jokes to be able to generate first and foremost a ton of social media
accounts using 2 or more strings to make the Browser create these in such a matter
that they are in fact being made at the same time. There should also be some type
of options when it does come to the customization of the accounts. should they
be linked?, Should they be generated with random Data. Or must it be specific.
As of right now we have been testing the framework now as The splinter Framework.
As such we may change this in the future so please do have patience. There also
may be a tool that will be released after the main Framework has been built called
Social Bot (will be integrated). (Probably 2-3 Months) It will use the api of the specific site site
selected andy read the config files with the appropriate pregenerated socials.
Then it will execute different types of spam attacks at your request.
We also wish to implement Store bots in the future but will not be giving any
Info on that behalf.
